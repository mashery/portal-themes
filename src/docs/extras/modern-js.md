# Working with Modern JavaScript

Mashery Portal 2 is a dependency-free Portal platform running on modern JavaScript APIs. It's possible to build a beautiful, modern looking site without using bloated libraries like jQuery.

To push support all the way back to IE 7 without the need for [precompilers like Babel](https://babeljs.io/), the Mashey Portal uses [polyfill.io](https://polyfill.io) to extend modern functionality back to older browsers.

There's also an robust [JavaScript API](/docs/read/customizing_your_portal/mashery_portal_2_documentation/JavaScript_API) for handling many common tasks.
